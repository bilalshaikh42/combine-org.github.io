BioPAX is a standard language that aims to enable integration, exchange and analysis of biological pathway data. It is expressed in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL/">OWL</a>. The last specification is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3-documentation.pdf">BioPAX Level 3</a>. BioPAX development is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.biopax.org/mediawiki/index.php/BioPAX_Governance">coordinated</a> by an elected editorial board and a Scientific Advisory Board. BioPAX is supported by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://biopax.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Category:SOFTWARE">many pathway database or processing tools</a>.
