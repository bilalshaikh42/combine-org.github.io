The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. COMBINE 2021 will be a workshop-style online event with oral presentations, breakout sessions and tutorials. The five meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials.

COMBINE 2021 will be an online (virtual) meeting from October 11th (Monday) to October 15th (Friday). It will provide a schedule which takes into account all time zones around the world, a real 24 hour conference. The meeting will be free of charge.
