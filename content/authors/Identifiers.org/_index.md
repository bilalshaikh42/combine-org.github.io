<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href=http://co.mbine.org/standards/miriam_uris"> MIRIAM Unique Resource Identifiers</a> allow one to uniquely and unambiguously identify an entity in a stable and perennial manner. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href=http://co.mbine.org/standards/miriam#MIRIAM_Registry_and_Identifiers.org"> MIRIAM Registry</a> is a set of services and resources that provide support for generating, interpreting and resolving MIRIAM URIs. Through the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href=http://identifiers.org/"> Identifiers.org </a> technology, MIRIAM URIs can be dereferenced in a flexible and robust way. 

MIRIAM URIs are used by SBML, SED-ML, CellML and BioPAX controlled annotation schemes.
