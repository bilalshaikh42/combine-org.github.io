The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://co.mbine.org/standards/sbo"> Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) </a> is a set of controlled, relational vocabularies of terms commonly used in Systems Biology, and in particular in computational modeling. 

Each element of an SBML file carries an optional attribute sboTerm which value must be a term from SBO. 

Each symbol of SBGN is associated with an SBO term.
