abstract: Synthetic biology has transformative potential in a variety of application
  areas including agriculture, energy, materials, and health. While much of the research
  in this field has been in E. Coli, many applications require yeast and other bacteria.
  Researchers often use trial-and-error, since information can be difficult to locate.
  The goal of the Synthetic Biology Knowledge System (SBKS) is to create an an open
  and integrated resource that harnesses disparate, heterogeneous data sources to
  accelerate scientific exploration and discovery. This abstract gives an overview
  of the SBKS project, while several other abstracts submitted to this workshop explain
  different aspects in more detail.
