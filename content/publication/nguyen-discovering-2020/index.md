abstract: This paper describes our work using named entity recognition (NER), a sub-field
  of text mining, to mine existing literature. The goal of NER is to locate and classify
  named entities present in text into pre-defined categories. For synthetic biology,
  examples of such categories are names of genes, vectors, and regulatory elements.
  NER in biology domains has additional challenges due to the pace of new named entities
  being added, lack of naming convention, lengthy names, presence of special characters,
  and frequent and variable use of abbreviations.
