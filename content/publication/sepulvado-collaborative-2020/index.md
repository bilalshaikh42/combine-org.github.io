abstract: Although synthetic biology is now an established field, ethical reflection
  surrounding it has only recently become a subject of sustained scientific inquiry.
  This poster displays the results from a series of network analyses examining how
  synthetic biology ethics is evolving. The studies gather ethics articles from 802
  institutions and 2,179 authors and suggest that the fields' social structure has
  become democratized at the individual level but remains dominated by a handful of
  institutions at the organizational level.
