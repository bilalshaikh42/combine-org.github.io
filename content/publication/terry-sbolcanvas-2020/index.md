abstract: Synthetic biologists often use diagrams to visualize the structure and functionality
  of genetic designs due to their complicated nature. The Synthetic Biology Open Language
  Visual (SBOLv) is a standard for these diagrams. This standard provides a set of
  glyphs for synthetic biology components and how they can interact. These visual
  designs also have a complementary data standard, the Synthetic Biology Open Language
  (SBOL), which represents the structural and functional information for genetic designs
  This paper describes SBOLCanvas, an updated web-based genetic design editor that
  can create visual diagrams using all features of SBOLv2.
