abstract: With the massive growth of community designed parts, opensource repositories
  such as SynBioHub [2] have become increasingly popular among synthetic biologists
  as a convenient way to store and share their genetic designs online. However, the
  sheer size of such repositories make it difficult to simply browse for the desired
  parts. The reference instance https://synbiohub.org) contains over 100,000 publicly
  available parts in its repository, not counting the various private repositories
  added by users. Currently, users can only find a part based on a keyword in the
  partâ€™s description, or through various filters such as date of creation, creator,
  or collection. However, prior to this work, it was not possible in SynBioHub to
  search for similar sequences.
