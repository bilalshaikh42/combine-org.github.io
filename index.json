As those efforts mature, they may become part of the core set of COMBINE standards.\nOne of the initial activities of COMBINE is to coordinate the organization of scientific and technical events common to several standards. Those events, as others related to our field of research are gathered in a calendar.\nTo discuss the goals, organization and operation of COMBINE, subscribe to COMBINE discuss mailing list.\nTo report issues about the co.mbine.org website, send a mail to combine-support @ googlegroups.com\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/combine/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/combine/","section":"authors","summary":"The \u0026ldquo;COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork\u0026rdquo; (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats for computational models.
